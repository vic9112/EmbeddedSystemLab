## Introduction
- With the STMicroelectronics Discovery kit for IoT node, users develop applications with direct connection to cloud servers. The Discovery kit enables a wide diversity of applications by exploiting low-power communication, multiway sensing and Arm® Cortex®-M4 core-based STM32L4+ Series features. The support for ARDUINO® Uno V3 and Pmod™ connectivity provides unlimited expansion capabilities with a large choice of specialized add-on boards.
