# Lab 4 Analog Input

## Lab Introduction
- The AnalogIn API is used to read (measure) an external voltage applied to an input pin. An analog to digital converter circuit (ADC) will sample and quantized the signal to digital formats.
- Because we need a ADC circuit to read from an analog signal, only certain pins of B_L4S5I_IOT01A are connected to ADC and capable of making these measurements. Please check the documentation of B_L4S5I_IOT01A for ADC pins.

## Equipment List
- B-L4S5I-IOT01A * 1
- USB Type-A male to USB Micro-B male * 1 (compatible with B-L4S5I-IOT01A)
- PicoScope * 1
- Jumper wire male to male
- Breadboard * 1 (with at least 64 rows of pins)
- LED * 1
- 220 Ohm Resistor * 1
